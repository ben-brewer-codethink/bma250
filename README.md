# bma250

Some hacks on the BMA250 accelerometer kernel driver. And yes, before you start complaining, I am aware that this driver is old and outdated. In the modern kernel it may be replaced by support within bma180, and there is also a driver under a different license which can be found here: https://github.com/BoschSensortec/BMA2x2_driver
